# GovHack-2023-Eco-Logical

## Project Description

Hobart has declared a climate and biodiversity emergency, experiencing the impacts of climate change, and in the future, anticipating an increased and more extreme weather events. Climate change will have a long-term impact on our communities, and the City of Hobart is seeking creative and innovative solutions that utilise open data to foster a deeper and greater understanding of the climate risk and enable community participation in these solutions.

ECoLogical is a 'livability portal' to accelerate Hobart Cities move towards zero emissions and climate resilience. It uses open data to calculate a liveability score of an area that will enable end-users across all sectors to make informed decisions that can contribute to the efforts towards a zero emissions and a more resilient Hobart.

## Data Story

Our approach was to gather a set of metrics/features that would indicate ESG metrics, climate change metrics and liveability metrics for Hobart. We starting with some exploratory data analysis on the datasets and then developed a data model in Python that would allow us to combine them.
We starting looking for geospatial data to plot in a single layered graph. After combining the multiple datasets from the competition challenge and other sources into a Jupyter notebook we then transformed the data into a Python web application with interactive features.
